Move along folks, nothing to see here, move along.

I thought I could make the code a little better.  Boy, that was a mistake.
All better now, but I also had to contend with the AI that is now
part of Visual Studio.

The source code was modified, well actuall brought up to snuff, for C++20.
That was a mistake.  The code was originally written using Visual Studio 6.0.
Modernizing it was not exactly what I had in mind to do, but you
do what you gotta do.

There were several things in the source code that were not a 
problem earlier.  Some of these were a real pain in the neck to
track down.  So there may be a few more revision in the guture.

Made a few changes.  I wanted to be able to disable object fills.
That really turned out to be one deep rabit hole.

Fixed a few more bugs.  Plenty more from where those came from.

The new version is not complete, and I really could use
a Draw Circle that starts at the center.  So, I decided to
put that into this old clunker.

I did manage to fix a couple of crashes, and I think I have the
Circle object completely integrated into the program, but then again
I am always suprised by something.  Still Broken, but not as broken as
was, but still as obscure as heck as how to use the program.

The original FrontCad.  I needed something real qucik, so rather than trying to finish
the new one, I thought I would just "fix" the old one.  Ended up taking three weeks.  What
a joke.  Anyway, here if you want it.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.
